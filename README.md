# Lab Introduction to Processes

## Goals

- Practice with thread concepts. 
- Using threads system calls in POSIX. 


## Statements

###  Exercise 01

Write a program that creates 1 thread that prints a message 3 times: "Thread says hi!", sleeps 1 second between each message and then indicates that it ends. The parent thread program must wait until the child thread terminates.

###  Exercise 02

Make a program that:

- declares a global variable "myglobal‚Äù
- creates 1 thread ``print_dots``. 
- The program then makes a for up to 20 in the increments myglobal by 1. Then it ends up printing the value of myglobal.
- The function ``print_dots`` executes a loop 20 where in each turn the value of myglobal is assigned to an auxiliary variable that is incremented. A "." Is printed. per lap. When finished, it sleeps 1sec and saves the auxiliary value in myglobal.

Request:

a) Implement the program

b) Run the program and see what happens to the value of myglobal. Is it the same if it is run multiple times?

###  Exercise 03

Write a program that creates a variable number of threads, indicated with an argument. 

- Create a function that prints "Hello from thread" and the thread number and ends.
- The parent receives the number of threads (integer) as an argument and executes a for loop that creates those threads. Then wait for all threads to finish and finish.

###  Exercise 04

Write a program that 

- Declares 2 functions, 1 and 2, where the identity of the thread that is executing is indicated. 
- function 1 sleeps 2 seconds and function 2 sleeps 5 seconds. 
 -Next the main program must launch 2 threads, one for each function, write its own identity and terminate.
 -Write a new version where the parent waits for the children to finish before finishing.
 
 ###  Exercise 05
 
Write a program that adds values in concurrency using threads. 

- The program declares a global variable sum_total 
- A procedure called ``add`` that increments ```total_addition``` by 100 using an intermediate local variable, sleeps for a second, and assigns the internal variable to ```total_addition```.
- The main then creates 10 threads ``add``, waits for them to finish, prints the computed sum value, and terminates.

As a variant, eliminate sleep time and indicate what happens.
